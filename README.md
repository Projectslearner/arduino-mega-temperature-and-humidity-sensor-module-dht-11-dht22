# Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module (DHT11/DHT22) Project

#### Project Overview
The Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module project showcases how to use an Arduino Mega with DHT11 or DHT22 sensors to monitor environmental conditions. These sensors provide accurate temperature and humidity readings, making them ideal for applications requiring climate monitoring or environmental control.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **DHT11 or DHT22 Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the DHT Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin (DHTPIN):** Connected to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **+V and GND:** Connected to the +5V and GND (ground) of the Arduino Mega, respectively.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe temperature and humidity readings displayed.
   - Ensure readings are within expected ranges for accuracy.

#### Applications
- **Indoor Climate Monitoring:** Monitor temperature and humidity levels indoors for comfort or HVAC system control.
- **Weather Stations:** Capture environmental data for weather forecasting or analysis.
- **Greenhouse Automation:** Automate watering or ventilation systems based on sensor readings for optimal plant growth.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Accuracy:** DHT sensors provide reliable readings but require occasional calibration for precise measurements.
- **Temperature Conversion:** Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion is included in the code for temperature readings.
- **Serial Output:** Use serial communication to output sensor data for real-time monitoring and debugging.
